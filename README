Shipwright


INSTALLATION

To install this module, run the following commands:

    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test
    make install

NOTES FOR USERS ON WINDOWS

Shipwright depends many UNIX shell cmds( e.g. ls, rm, mv ), so if you are
on Windows, you need to install a UNIX Utility software that supplied those
cmds, e.g. http://sourceforge.net/projects/unxutils/ can do this.
