Let's run the tutorial, if it works, it works ;)

Ok, we'll build a simple project, e.g we want to build Acme::Hello( we love
examples with name hello ;) 
The repo is svk://__shipwright/hello. 
Here's the instructions:

1. init 

$ shipwright create -r svk://__shipwright/hello

2. import

$ shipwright import -r svk://__shipwright/hello Acme::Hello

Then shipwright will try to download, and import Acme::Hello and all its deps.
If you want to skip some deps, e.g. Locale::Maketext and
Locale::Maketext::Lexicon, just add `--skip Locale::Maketext and Locale::Maketext::Lexicon' arg

run `shipwright help import' to get more options

3. build

$ shipwright build -r svk://__shipwright/hello

Test is kind of time consuming? you can add `--skip-test' to skip test.

run `shipwright help build' to get more options

the log of the above 3 commands can be found in tutorial.log
4. update some dists

if you just want to update a dist( just the dist source itself, don't want to
update build or require.yml ), use the `update' cmd.
techenically, it will delete the dir in dists and import again.

if not, you can import it again, which will overwrite the old one. 
techenically, it will delete the corresponding dir
in dists/ and scripts/, then add new one. 
If you want to overwrite dep dists too, please use --overwrite
