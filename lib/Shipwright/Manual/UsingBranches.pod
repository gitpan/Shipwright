Shipwright::Manual::UsingBranches - Using branches

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Shipwright B<branches> is a method to keep multiple sources for one source,
a bit like branches in vcs.
Technically, all the sources for I<foo> live below I<sources/foo/>.

Sources from CPAN can't be branched, or in the other way, can only have one branch.
Technically, only dists occurred in shipwright/source.yml can be branched.

Imagine we have an app Foo, of which the layout in vcs is like:
trunk/...
branches/1.0/...
branches/2.0/...

With B<branches> support, we can add all the 3 versions in shipwright:

    $ shipwright import -r ... svn:.../trunk --name Foo --as trunk
    $ shipwright import -r ... svn:.../branches/1.0 --name Foo --as branches/1.0
    $ shipwright import -r ... svn:.../branches/2.0 --name Foo --as branches/2.0

the branch names can be whatever you want, no need to be the same layout as your 
vcs system
now we have I<trunk>, I<1.0> and I<2.0> branches in shipwright:

    $ shipwright list -r ... Foo

will show "branches: trunk, branches/1.0, branches/2.0"

When build, the 1st one will be treated as the default branch.
to change the default branch, e.g. we want to change 2.0 as the default:

    $ shipwright defaultbranch -r ... Foo branches/2.0

If we don't want to change the default branch, we can also supply --branch arg 
when build:

    $ ./bin/shipwright-builder --branches Foo=branches/2.0

Note:

Since all these branches share the same build script and the same dep sources,
if branches are way too different, it's better to import it as another source
instead of branching.
